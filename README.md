This python code work like a mini chatbot 
I used gemini AI API to run this code .It is very simple to execute this in your pc.
open cmd and nevigate the path to file where you saved.Then Run the command "py file_name.py",here file_name means how you save this file in your pc.By default 
what i used as file name it will remains same....

thank you
